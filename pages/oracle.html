ORACLE_SCHEMA_USERNAME ORACLE_SCHEMA_PASSWORD Schema username ï The current naming convention for the schema username is: Sys: ${SCHEMA}_SYS Acc: ${SCHEMA}_ACC Stage: ${SCHEMA}_SAM Prod: ${SCHEMA}_PROD Schema password ï The current naming convention for the schema password is: Sys: ${SCHEMA}_SYS Acc: ${SCHEMA}_ACC Stage: ${SCHEMA}_SAM Prod: Autogenerated and stored in https://vault.sbab.se/ui/vault/secrets/prod/list/oracle-db-sbab-services/ E.g. https://vault.sbab.se/ui/vault/secrets/prod/show/oracle-db-sbab-services/p/PABLO_FOO Release Liquibase Locks ï The tools/release-liquibase-locks pipeline releases all locks that older than 6 minutes.
The pipeline will by default delete locks in TEST (Sys, Acc, Stage/Sam). To release the locks for one specific schema (again, only locks older than 6 minutes), specify the SCHEMA_NAME variable. Release ALL locks ï If the SCHEMA_NAME variable is left empty, then all locks (older than 6 minutes) will be released in the specified environment.
This is usually used by e.g. TNT and OPS when all micro services have to be redeployed, which might causes locks in multiple services. Schema deletion ï Stay tuned, soon coming for test environments. For production, always contact #team-oracle-dev . Previous Next © Copyright 2024, TNT.
