The local Ansible Controller behaves similar to the Ansible Controllers in Jenkins. The Vagrant machine is used to
provision all other machines in the private network. Start by starting and SSH:ing into the ansible machine. The most common operations have been setup as aliases in ~/.bash_profile inside the machine, which are displayed right after login. All commands are executed as the vagrant user from the /ansible directory. Docker ï The ansible-controller, previously only available through Vagrant, is now also available as a docker image. Pre-requisities ï To be able to run the ansible-controller, in docker, on your local machine you will have to
install Docker. To do this, please, follow the instructions given here: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ Setup ï A nice way to configure an easy way to go to the ansible-controller environment
from your local shell is to e.g. add the following alias to your ~/.bashrc (for bash shell): alias ansiblectl = 'docker run -it --rm -v <local ansible directory>:/ansible nexus.common.sbab.se:18443/se.sbab/ansible-controller' Where you replace <local ansible directory> with the full path to your git clone of the ansible project. Note If you are running this on a non-linux host, you are probably running docker in a vm (Virtual machine).
When running on a vm, you will need to mount your local projects directory, and the <local ansible directory> should then rather be replaced with the full path to the ansible directory on the docker vm. Running ï When everything is installed and configured, you should be able to simply run ansiblectl in your terminal and
you will be in the ansible-controller environment. Note The first time you run the ansiblectl command alias, docker will have to pull the docker image from our
Nexus server, this might take a couple of minutes.
