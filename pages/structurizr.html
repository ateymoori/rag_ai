We will use this
internally to create and generate diagrams of our internal technical infrastructure. Most (hopefully all) structural components of the diagrams in Structurizr will be generated by scripts. Please refer to the official Structurizr site for documentation and usage instructions https://structurizr.com/ URLâs ï Lab: http://structurizr.lab.sbab.se Common: http://structurizr.common.sbab.se Deploying the service ï As the Structurizr service should allow us to create a diagram for our full internal infrastructure, we have chosen to
deploy the service to our oscommon environment. Deployment is done through ansible, like so: ansible-playbook -i inventories/oscommon playbooks/deploy-structurizr.yml -e docker_image_tag = ${ DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG } Where ${DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG} should be replaced by the version tag of the latest successful build of the Jenkins build
job of the master branch ( see: https://jenkins.common.sbab.se:8443/job/DKR/job/structurizr/job/master/ ) Testing in oslab ï When working on the Structurizr service, and deployment, one should do all test-deployments to our k8s cluster in oslab ansible-playbook -i inventories/oslab playbooks/deploy-structurizr.yml -e docker_image_tag = ${ DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG } Where ${DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG} should be replaced by the version tag of your specific build of the Jenkins build job of
the DKR/structurizr project ( see: https://jenkins.common.sbab.se:8443/job/DKR/job/structurizr ) Previous Next © Copyright 2024, TNT. Built with Sphinx using a theme provided by Read the Docs .
