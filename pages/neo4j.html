create a map/graph that visualizes our internal IT system infrastructure & architecture. Neo4J has been deployed for our sys environment, in order to store part of the technical
infrastructure data, and help with visualizing it. Note Currently the Neo4J installation is a Community Edition instance, which means that
it does not support multiple databases, nor does it support HA (High Availability)
clustering Service configuration ï To configure a micro-service to use Neo4J you will need to set some of your configurations in
the env file of your project repositoryâs /config directory. E.g. like this: # /config/sys/env.list NEO4J_USERNAME ={{ neo4j_service_username }} NEO4J_PASSWORD ={{ neo4j_service_password }} NEO4J_URL ={{ neo4j_service_url }} Previous Next © Copyright 2024, TNT.
