Using Kafka Connect you can use existing connector implementations for common data sources and sinks to move data into and out of Kafka. At SBAB team TNT runs the Kafka Connect platform, users commit their connector configurations to the kafka-connect-connectors repository and they are loaded into Kafka Connect for execution. Local development ï For developing locally, running Kafka and Kafka Connect in Docker, please refer to the upstream documentation from Confluence. You only need to complete âStep 1: Download and Start Confluence Platform Using Dockerâ to get everything up and running. After that there is a nice web UI at http://localhost:9021 and you can also directly access the Kafka Connect REST API at http://localhost:8083 Please refer to the documentation for the various connectors - TNT cannot answer questions on how to configure connectors better than the documentation can. When troubleshooting, read the logs from the Kafka Connect Docker container: docker logs connect Committing connectors ï Please commit the JSON file(s) containing your connector configuration to config/templates directory in the Bitbucket project TNT/kafka-connect-connectors . You can template values from Ansible in the JSON file, have a look at one of the other connectors in the repository for examples. If you have been developing locally as per the instructions above, you can export the connector configuration by running for instance: curl -sS -o your-connector.json http://localhost:8083/connectors/<your-connector>/config Please run the JSON file through jq or something else to pretty print it before committing it. Troubleshooting connectors ï Before you commit and start to use connectors it is a pretty good idea to read this article on error handling . For the most basic of troubleshooting, ie. is my connector loaded and running in Kafka Connect? Please refer to the Kafka Connect dashboard in Grafana. If your connector is loaded but not running a useful Splunk search is: source=kafka-connect.sys AND "ERROR WorkerSourceTask{id=*" How useful the above Splunk search is will largely depend on how you have configured your connector, again see the article above.
