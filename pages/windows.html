Pre-requisites ï Before running any pipeline for deployment against a Windows host, there are a few steps
to take for allowing Ansible to connect and make changes to the targeted host. These steps are copied from this Confluence page: Ansible - Windows hosts Windows Server 2008 ï Install .NET Framework 4.0 (or higher) Install Powershell 3.0 (or higher) PowerShell 3.0 is only supported on Windows 7 SP1, Windows Server 2008 SP1, and later releases of Windows. Enable Windows to use WinRM (Windows Remote Management) communication. Ansible provides a powershell script for doing this. https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1 The script will create and use a self-signed certificate for enabling SSL communication via WinRM. Add the domain user SBABs-ansble-prd to the administrators group on the target host. Windows Server 2012 ï Enable Windows to use WinRM (Windows Remote Management) communication. Ansible provides a powershell script for doing this. https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1 The script will create and use a self-signed certificate for enabling SSL communication via WinRM. Add the domain user SBABs-ansble-prd to the administrators group on the target host. Note Ansible might need Python to be installed on the windows machine. Check the documentation
of the deployment pipeline, below, if it states that Python must be installed. Existing pipeline types ï In this section we list all currently existing deployment pipeline types supported by Team TNT. If you are in need of a type of deployment pipeline that is not specified below,
please contact Team TNT in out Slack channel #team-tnt or create a Jira ticket in the TNT project. Windows Repo Deploy ï This is a very simple deployment pipeline which will deploy the contents of a repository
to the targeted Windows host. To use this, please add a file named Jenkinsfile like the
example documented here Windows Repo Deploy Remote connection ï To be able to connect to the remote Windows machine: Use âMicrosoft Remote Connectionâ to connect to v-004.sbab.ad with sa account Then from v-004.sbab-ad connect to sbb-p1-sastst1.sbb.sth.basefarm.net with s-ansible-prd as username Password can be obtain here for dev: ansible/inventories/sys/group_vars/windows/vault.yml Repository branches ï This pipeline is made to support deployment from the dev and master branches of the git repository
containing the before mentioned Jenkinsfile Branch Ansible Inventory dev sys master production Previous © Copyright 2024, TNT. Built with Sphinx using a theme provided by Read the Docs .
