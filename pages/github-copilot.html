Itâs designed to assist developers by providing code suggestions, auto-completions and context-aware documentation
as they write code in various programming languages and frameworks. Copilot integrates directly into code editors, such as Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA, and offers real-time
assistance as you type. It can help with a wide range of tasks, from writing functions, classes or entire code blocks
to generating tests, explaining code and fixing defects. It learns from public repositories and adapts to your coding style, which helps it generate more accurate suggestions
over time. Warning While Copilot aims to generate meaningful and relevant code snippets, making coding faster and more efficient, it is
important to review and validate suggestions as they might not always be error-free or aligned with your specific
requirements. Getting started ï Note Before using GitHub Copilot at SBAB, you must complete a basic mandatory training session. You need to have an SBAB connected GitHub account in order to use GitHub Copilot. It is used to authenticate and
authorize Copilotâs access and to personalize your codding style and preferences. Create an SBAB GitHub account : Use your SBAB email address to create a GitHub account with suggested username <sbab-username>-sbab . Connect your GitHub account to Organization SBABBANK : Send an email with your GitHub username and email to patrice . mangelsdorf @ sbab . se with the following text: I participated in the Github Copilot education and understand the risks which come with using this tool. My GitHub account is xxxx-sbab. GitHub Copilot offers support for a number of environments, including JetBrains IDEs and Visual Studio Code.
Follow the Getting started guide
for your preferred environment. Warning Only official plugins and extensions developed by GitHub are currently allowed to be installed and used at SBAB. For Intellij IDEA, install the GitHub Copilot plugin. For Visual Studio Code, install the GitHub Copilot and the GitHub Copilot Chat extensions. Tip Use the #github-copilot Slack channel to ask questions and share
your experience with GitHub Copilot. Read the official GitHub Copilot documentation for more information. Usage ï GitHub Copilot can generate code based on the current context, such as method name, parameters, return type, etc.
or based on a comment. It can also explain code and fix defects and more. GitHub Copilot Chat is a chat interface that lets you ask and receive answers to coding-related questions directly
within a supported IDE. Copilot Chat can help you with a variety of coding-related tasks, like offering you code
suggestions, providing natural language descriptions of a piece of codeâs functionality and purpose, generating unit
tests for your code, and proposing fixes for bugs in your code. More information available at About GitHub Chat . Note GitHub Copilot Chat is currently in limited public beta for organizations and enterprises with a Business
subscription, and is subject to changes. Best practices ï Here are some best practices for using GitHub Copilot effectively: Review and validate suggestions : While GitHub Copilot aims to generate meaningful and relevant code snippets, it
is important to review and validate suggestions as they might not always be error-free or aligned with your specific
requirements. Always double-check the code generated by Copilot before using it in your project. Use Copilot as a tool to assist developers, not replace them : GitHub Copilot is designed to assist developers by
providing code suggestions and auto-completions, but it should not be used as a replacement for human developers.
Always use your own judgment and expertise when writing code, and use Copilot as a tool to help you write code
faster and more efficiently. Personalize your coding style and preferences : GitHub Copilot learns from your coding style and adapts to your
preferences over time. To get the most out of Copilot, make sure to personalize your coding style and preferences by
providing feedback and correcting any mistakes. Provide feedback to improve the tool : GitHub Copilot is still a relatively new tool, and there may be areas where
it can be improved. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for how to improve Copilot, make sure to provide
feedback to the GitHub team so that they can continue to improve the tool. Avoid using sensitive or personal information in your code : Whenever possible, avoid hard-coding information
such as passwords or private keys in your code. Instead, use environment variables or configuration files to store
this information, and make sure to exclude these files from version control. Always handle personal information with
care and follow the Security Guidelines for SBAB . By following these best practices, you can use GitHub Copilot effectively to write code faster and more efficiently,
while still maintaining high standards for code quality. Previous Next © Copyright 2024, TNT. Built with Sphinx using a theme provided by Read the Docs .
